## [Brief](#Index)

Decided to journal a glossary of technical terms I can carry around and refer
to explicitly.

If the glossary looks/feels/sounds familiar as you read it, don't be alarmed!
It's actually modelled after [Wikipedia](#https://wikipedia.org). The
difference is that the glossary is explicitly flat by nature.

### [Structure](#Brief)

This glossary aims for a very flat structure, the terms listed start at the
["Terms" h2 header](#Terms) and entries are checked in under a h3 tag which
may then be followed by zero or more h4 tags depicting synonmyms for the term.

The entries are interned in alphabetical order (by their h3 tag) without
discrimination or where the smallest diff can be produced by [Git](#Git).

## [Terms](#Index)
