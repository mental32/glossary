### Kernel

> Extract from wiki.osdev.org:
>
> The kernel is the central component of an operating system. It is a natural
> consequence of an operating system's need to manage resources, and often the
> most important part of a operating system. Its responsibilities include
> managing memory and devices and also providing an interface for software
> applications to use those resources. Depending on the architecture of the
> operating system, the kernel often manages protection of programs and
> multitasking.
