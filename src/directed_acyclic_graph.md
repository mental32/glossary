### Directed acyclic graph
#### DAG

In mathematics, graph theory and computer science, a DAG is a finite directed
graph (A graph made up of vertices connected by a set of edges) with no direct
cycles (Following any node n or vertex v will always lead toward a terminal leaf
and will never loop).

They have the property of topological sorting/ordering (Needs further elaboration.)
